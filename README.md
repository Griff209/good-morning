Display a daily greeting and 'this date in history' facts or births, HTML/JS/CSS + Sinatra

A bit of fun, requested by a house-mate. Used as a playground / learning 
sandbox for me. Meant to be cast from a tab on my computer to the ChromeCast / our TV. 
Primarily Javascript, HTML intentionally very lean, CSS used for experimentation
and fun with animation. Sinatra is used too. Also experimenting
with ES6 syntax (const, =>, so forth).
